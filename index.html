    <p>I like to take videos from youtube and edit them so they are shorter or have a new sound alltogether. I make them louder or quieter. </p>

    <h4>This is a little bit about me.</h4>
    <p>Hello My name is Benjamin Watts. I am an amateur programmer. So forgive me if I have mispelled anything or have something messed up in the code. If that happens tell me right away and I will fix it. 
    </p>
    <p>Now that that is out of the way, here is some things you might like to know. I go by the online name of Shadowfang95. I mainly do html and python programs because I am lazy. But..come on who isn't lazy now adays. So I stick with what I'm good at editing audio and makeing websites.</p>
    <p>I love the EDM's and trap songs. I also like to have fun and hang out with friends. Now I know by now I must be boring you with things that I like and don't like but it will get more interesting as you go through this website.
    <h5>(Hopefully)üòÅ</h5>
