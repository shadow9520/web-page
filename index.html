    <p>Now that that is out of the way, here is some things you might like to know. I go by the online name of Shadowfang95. I mainly do html and python programs because I am lazy. But..come on who isn't lazy now adays. So I stick with what I'm good at editing audio and makeing websites.</p>
    <p>I love the EDM's and trap songs. I also like to have fun and hang out with friends. Now I know by now I must be boring you with things that I like and don't like but it will get more interesting as you go through this website.
    <h5>(Hopefully)üòÅ</h5>
